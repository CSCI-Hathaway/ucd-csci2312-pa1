## CSCI 2312: Programming Assignment 1

This program takes in 3 points from the user for each point (A total of 3)
This program then stores the values of the three objects of a class called Point, making three objects.
Those objects are passed into a function called computeArea which determines the area of the triangle made
with the 3 coordinates using Heron's formula, returning the area at the end and displaying it to the user.

Inside the Point class there is a function called distanceTo which determines the distance between two coordinates.
This function is used in the distanceTo function to determine all three side lengths of the triangle to compute area.
